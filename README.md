Application tool that automatically generates prompts with one click.

The tool is designed to help users generate prompts for various tasks, such as text generation, text classification, and text summarization. The tool uses the OpenAI compatible API to generate prompts and provides users with a simple interface to input their desired task and parameters.

This project is inspired by the [Claude AI prompt generator](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-generator) and aims to provide a similar experience for generating prompts with a simple and intuitive interface.
