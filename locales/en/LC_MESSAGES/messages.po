"Welcome to the Metaprompt! This is a prompt engineering tool designed to solve "
"the \"blank page problem\" and give you a starting point for iteration. All you "
"need to do is enter your task, and optionally the names of the variables you'd "
"like Claude to use in the template. Then you'll be able to run the prompt that "
"comes out on any examples you like.\n"
"\n"
"**Caveats**\n"
"- This is designed for single-turn question/response prompts, not multiturn.\n"
"- The Metaprompt is designed for use with Claude 3 Opus. Generating prompts "
"with other models may lead to worse results.\n"
"- The prompt you'll get at the end is not guaranteed to be optimal by any means, "
"so don't be afraid to change it!"
